# ZapXML Source Code
ZapXML is a program that is intended to help with the creation of trigger codes. 
This is the source code for it.
(Godot 4.4.1)

## Be Aware That
- ZapXML is a learning project I made to get more familiar with the Godot engine, so the code is kind of all over the place.

[This software is intended to be used with Vectorier, a vector level editor.](https://github.com/FlipThoseTitle/Vectorier-Unity-Editor)

# Shoutout to floofly. (MrSampleJay) for helping me on understanding vectorier trigger codes.
